# week

`val week: `[`Int`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-int/index.html)`?`

Week of the event relative to the first official season event, zero-indexed. Only valid for Regionals, Districts, and District Championships. Null otherwise. (Eg. A season with a week 0 'preseason' event does not count, and week 1 events will show 0 here. Seasons with a week 0.5 regional event will show week 0 for those event(s) and week 1 for week 1 events and so on.)
